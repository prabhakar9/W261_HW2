A typical example of a race condition may occur in a system of logic gates where inputs vary. If a given output depends on the state of the inputs it may only be defined for steady-state signals. As the inputs change state a small delay will occur before the output changes due to the physical nature of the electronic system. The output may, for a brief period, change to an unwanted state before settling back to the designed state. Certain systems can tolerate such glitches but if this output functions as a clock signal for further systems that contain memory, for example, the system can rapidly depart from its designed behaviour (in effect, the temporary glitch becomes a permanent glitch).
